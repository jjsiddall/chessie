In exchange for being patient, all of your pieces are well defended throughout the opening. This opening is recommended against novice opponents that are overly aggressive. Let them remove their own defenses for you, while your king is tucked away safely. There are faster defenses, but the King’s Defense has a n added element of center control. This will allow more powerful attacks later on in the game.
