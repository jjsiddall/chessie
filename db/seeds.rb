Open game simply means a game where white and black both move their king’s side pawn first. This opening flows naturally from this first move, providing excellent center control, a swift attack, and the option for a castle early on. It’s likely that novice opponents will make mistakes in the opening. We’ll show the best moves for black, but if your opponent does not follow these moves, remember to immediately take any unprotected pieces. If black’s pieces are well defended, simply move on to complete the Ruy Lopez.",  :start => "a8-black-♜,b8-black-♞,c8-black-♝,d8-black-♛,e8-black-♚,f8-black-♝,g8-black-♞,h8-black-♜,a7-black-♟,b7-black-♟,c7-black-♟,d7-black-♟,e7-black-♟,f7-black-♟,g7-black-♟,h7-black-♟,a2-white-♟,b2-white-♟,c2-white-♟,d2-white-♟,e2-white-♟,f2-white-♟,g2-white-♟,h2-white-♟,a1-white-♜,b1-white-♞,c1-white-♝,d1-white-♛,e1-white-♚,f1-white-♝,g1-white-♞,h1-white-♜" },

The Caro-Kann defense is actually an attack that can punish opponents for mistakes more than any other opening in this book.

After a few moves, however, it becomes apparent that white can take revenge on the same black pawn after isolating it from any defenders.
